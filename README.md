# Two Car racing is an addictive car game.  It tests your reflexes. 
# You have two cars (Red and Blue), each of which have control of two parallel lanes, moving simultaneously in one direction. 
# Both cars have blocks (squares) and circles in their way. 
# The circles work like checkpoints that you cannot avoid if you need to continue forward.
# squares need to be maneuvered around to avoid collision. 
# In other words, you will lose in the game if you leave any circles or if you hit any squares. 
# Press Left and Right arrow keys to change the lane of red and blue car respectively. 
# Collecting each circle adds one point to the scorecard.
